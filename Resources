What skills do I need to be an Android Developer?
An Android developer works with the Android SDK (software development kit) and the Android operating system. They will need to understand the Android SDK, 
different versions of Android, and how these two things interact. An Android developer may need to know Java, Kotlin, C++, or all three languages and will need 
to understand the basics of SQL and XML. Java and Kotlin are programming languages used with Android, while SQL is used for database work, and XML is used for markup. 
Android developers should generally be competent programmers who understand both back-end and front-end development, emphasizing back-end or full-stack engineering. 
In terms of front-end knowledge, they should know the basics of UI (user interfaces) and UX (user experience). Android developers may work alone or in teams and may 
also need knowledge of project management strategies such as Agile.
